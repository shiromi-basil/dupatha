				<p><b><center>Experience the history and culture of Sri
				Lanka in this tour that covers the most of what this
				ancient island has to offer.<br>A cultural experience 
				with a touch of luxury.
				</center> </b>
				</p>
				
				<p>This comprehensive tour begins with four nights based in the centre of the island’s famous Cultural Triangle, enabling you to explore the sites of the island’s ancient culture, and even go on safari, at a leisurely pace. The appreciation of the island’s diverse culture continues with a two-night stay in Kandy, the capital of the former medieval kingdom, with a cultural dance performance and a visit to the legendary Temple of the Tooth. Experience the colonial culture that thrived on tea production during a stay at the hill station of Nuwara Eliya before a chance to explore Colombo with its grand Edwardian buildings and a visit to wander the cobbled streets of the colonial fort of Galle, number 200 on UNESCO’s list of world heritage sites, with its ramparts, cobbled streets and boutique shops.
